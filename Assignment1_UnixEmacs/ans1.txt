    man apropos
    man -k ls
    To print commands with <word> in their man page, use: man -k <word>
2.  whereis cp
    whereis wc
    The cp program is located in /bin/cp and the wc program is in /usr/bin/wc
3.  man -k executable
    man find
    find --help
    find / -executable
    find / -name '?' -executable
    find /usr/bin -name '?' -executable
    whatis w
    whatis X

4.  cd /usr/bin
    ls -l
      emacs -> /etc/alternatives/emacs
    cd /etc/alternatives
    ls -l
      emacs -> /usr/bin/emacs-23.1
    cd /usr/bin
    ls -l
    The emacs file that is actually executed is emacs-23.1 in /usr/bin
5.  man chmod
    info coreutils 'chmod invocation'
    touch test.txt
    ls -l
    chmod g+s test.txt
    ls -l
    touch test2.txt
    chmod +x test2.txt
    ls -l
    chmod o-x test2.txt
    ls -l
    For permissions, g+s gives special permissions by setgid. For an executable,
    the permissions for the running file are based on owner/group of file rather
    than user running it.
    Chmod o-x removes executing permissions from "others".
6.  man find
    find -mtime 21
    find -mtime +21
    find -mtime -21
    If -mtime, the find command looks for files modified in the last # days. If
    +mtime, it looks for files modified before the last # days.
7.  find -mtime -21 -type d
    To see the same info but for directories, just add -type d to the #6 answer.
8.  whereis find
    cd /bin
    ls

    * C-M-b: Moves backwards by expressions
    * C-M-c: Exit a recursive edit
    * C-M-d: Move down in the parenthesis structure
    * C-M-e: Moves to the end of the current/following function
    * C-M-f: Move forwards by expressions
    * C-M-g: A quit command like C-g.
    * C-M-h: Marks the current or following function.
13. emacs
    C-h r
    *scroll down to Key Index*
    enter
    *scroll down to C-g*
    enter

15. cd /usr/bin
    emacs
    C-x d
    C-x C-c
    ls -l
    man ls
    ls -la
    The ls -l command prints everything in the current directory in the long
    format unless the entry starts with '.', or is a hidden file. ls -la matches
    the dired command by printing everything in long format.
    The dired command prints everything in a directory. It is "read-only" and is
    as extensive as ls -la, and shows all files unlike ls -l.
