Assignment 3 - Modifying and Rewriting Software - lab3.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To download coreutils-7.6.tar.gz, we use the following wget command:

wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

After downloading it, we can untar the .tar.gz:

tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

This will create the directory coreutils-7.6 in the home directory, or wherever
you downloaded the .tar.gz to. Then create the coreutilsInstall folder:

mkdir coreutilInstall

Enter the coreutils-7.6 directory and run the configure command so that it will
be installed in ~/coreutilsInstall:

./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/wijaya/coreutilsInstall

Then make, and make install in order to actually install coreutils according to
the makefile:

make
make install

If you change directories to ~/coreutilsInstall, there will now be three
directories. coreutilsInstall/bin contains the binary ls file. In order to test
whether or not the bug can be replicated, we change the locale to "en_US.UTF-8"
with the following command:

export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

Then, try the default ls command (installed in /usr/bin) and then the installed
coreutils ls command:

ls -l
./ls -l

The latter command, ./ls -l, runs the binary ls contained in the current
directory (coreutilsInstall/bin). It does not display the traditional Unix
format with output like 2009-03-02 rather than Mar 2 2009.

To fix this, change back to ~/coreutils-7.6 and create a patch_file from
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2009-09/msg00410.html. Run the
patch with the following command:

patch -p1 < patch_file

The -p1 option strips one of the leading slashes from each file name in the
patch_file. For example, a/src/ls.c becomes src/ls.c. I then used the `make`
command in coreutils-7.6 to recompile relevant files affected by the patch.

make

We don't want to reinstall it elsewhere, so we just need make. I then created
two test files to see whether the patch worked on both a recent file and one
over a year old:

touch -t 201401210959.30 katrina
touch wijaya

I ran the buggy ls version from coreutilsInstall and the newly compiled version
to verify that the patch worked. The patched version showed the correct
traditional Unix format:

../coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l
./src/ls -l

Both commands were run from ~/coreutils-7.6. The latter command ran the patched
ls command in coreutils-7.6 while the prior one ran the buggy one that was
installed by default with coreutils-7.6 in coreutilsInstall. The outputs of the
commands with the buggy ls and patched ls are as follows (respectively):

2014-01-21 09:59 katrina
2016-10-10 23:26 wijaya

Jan 21  2014 katrina
Oct 10 23:26 wijaya

From the output, we can see that the patched output follows the traditional Unix
format while the buggy one does not. We can see with the new file (wijaya) and
old file (katrina) that for the new one the time last modified is displayed
while for the file that is older than a year the year it was last modified is
displayed.
