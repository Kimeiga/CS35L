Assignment 4: Change Management - hw4.txt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I checked out version 3.0 of Diffutils and branched into quote.

cd diffutils
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

I then installed my patch into the quote branch with the patch command.

patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt

The resulting output was as follows:
[wijaya@lnxsrv04 ~/4Asgn/gitdir/diffutils]$ patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

We can see that the only 6 files that were modified were the 6 I modified for
the patch.

I then used the Emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) to
create a ChangeLog for the 6 modifications I made in the patch.

emacs
C-x 4 a
I entered all 6 files that were changed and added brief modification description
        * src/cmp.c:    Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe
        * src/diff.c:   Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe
        * src/diff3.c:  Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe
        * src/dir.c:    Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe
        * src/sdiff.c:  Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe
        * src/util.c:   Replaced backtick quotes with an apostrophe

I then added and committed these changes and verified that it worked with git
log. When I used git log, I saw my ChangeLog logged. The -F option takes a
commit message from a given file.

git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog
git log

The output from the git commit command was as follows:
[wijaya@lnxsrv04 ~/4Asgn/gitdir/diffutils]$ git commit -F ChangeLog

After I committed, I then created a formatted patch for other people to get my
changes.

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I verified that my patch worked with a partner, Jennifer Cheng. We sent each
other our formatted-path.txt files with scp, checked out a new branch, and
tested it. The scp command was run from Jennifer's server.

scp formatted-patch.txt wijaya@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu:~/gitdir/diffutils/

git checkout v3.0 -b partner
git am < formatted-patch.txt

After running the git am command, we both received the following error:
[wijaya@lnxsrv05 ~/4Asgn/gitdir/diffutils]$ git am < formatted-patch.txt
previous rebase directory
/u/cs/ugrad/wijaya/4Asgn/gitdir/diffutils/.git/rebase-apply
still exists but mbox given.

The solution was to run the following command and then run git am again, which
succeeded.

git am --abort
git am < formatted-patch.txt

I then tested her patch by remaking diffutils.

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

I then verified her patch with the following commands:

./src/diff . -
./src/diff --help
git log

The resulting error messages showed '-' rather than the previous `-', indicating
that the patch was successful. I also checked git log and saw her ChangeLog.

I then switched back to my branch quote to verify that my ChangeLog entry
worked. I ran the command make distdir and inspected the resulting
diffutils*/Changelog file. This was in diffutils-3.0.1-0f16)

make distdir
cd diffutils*
emacs ChangeLog

Looking at the ChangeLog, I see my last Changelog addition.

I then logged out and in to the linux server, and then went to the copy of the
GNU Emacs git repository's master branch on SEASnet in the directory
~eggert/src/gnu/emacs.

ssh -X wijaya@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

When I ran gitk, I got the following error:

Application initialization failed: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment
variable
Error in startup script: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable
    while executing
"load /usr/lib64/tk8.5/../libtk8.5.so Tk"
    ("package ifneeded Tk 8.5.7" script)
    invoked from within
"package require Tk"
    (file "/usr/local/cs/bin/gitk" line 10)

I resolved this issue by downloading X11 from https://www.xquartz.org/ and
restarting my computer. I then ran the same steps. I ran gitk on it, and found
the newest merge that is newer than 2015-01-25. The screenshot can be found at
gitk-screenshot.png and a description of the subwindows in the screenshot in
gitk-description.txt.

ssh -X wijaya@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk
