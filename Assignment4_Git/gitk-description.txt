The top left window shows the repository structure such as the branches and
commits and merges. It shows the HEAD and master branch. The associated names
and emails are in the top middle section, with the dates of the commits in the
top right.

In the bottom section, there is more information about the commit shown. For
instance, there is a bar allowing for searching through commits by hash, commit
name, etc. In the bottom left, the ChangeLog for the commit is depicted, as well
as the diff. To the right shows all the files that had been changed or modified
in the commit.
